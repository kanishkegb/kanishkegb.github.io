# Open-Source Contributions

A selcted set of open-source repositories where I am the main contributor and maintainer. 
For most up-to-date details please visit [my GitHub page](https://github.com/kanishkegb).


## Working examples/tutorial for detection and pose estimation of ArUco markers with C++: [fdcl-gwu/aruco-markers](https://github.com/fdcl-gwu/aruco-markers)

![Drawing a cube on an AruCo marker](../../../../assets/images/aruco_markers.gif)

This is a side project that resulted from the work published in my paper “Attitude observer on SO (3) with time-varying reference directions”. 
This repository provides C++ codes for basic augmented reality related tasks using computer vision. 
In fact, this is usually withing the first three Google results when you search for ArUco markers using C++.

## Geometric controllers developed at FDCL for UAVs : [fdcl-gwu/uav_geometric_control](https://github.com/fdcl-gwu/uav_geometric_control)

![Projects that used the controllers in the repository](../../../../assets/images/uav_geometric_control.png)

This repository includes the controller proposed in “Geometric controls of a quadrotor UAV with decoupled yaw control”.
In addition, this includes both coupled-yaw and decoupled-yaw controllers in Matlab, Python, and C++ for any interested person to use in their projects.

## Python - Gazebo simulation environment for a UAV with geometric control: [fdcl-gwu/uav_simulator](https://github.com/fdcl-gwu/uav_simulator)

![UAV Simulator GUI](../../../../assets/images/uav_simulator.gif)

This is another output of the work published in “Geometric controls of a quadrotor UAV with decoupled yaw control”. 
This includes a complete framework for simulating a UAV, which includes controller, estimator, using an open-source physics engine.

## Comparison of delayed Kalman filters, with application to the state estimation of a UAV: [fdcl-gwu/dkf-comparison](https://github.com/fdcl-gwu/dkf-comparison)

{% include video id="PfuGb5yhlLQ" provider="youtube" %}

This work includes the results published in “Quadrotor State Estimation with IMU and Delayed Real-time Kinematic GPS”, which compares different delayed Kalman filters for their performances.
