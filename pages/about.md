I am a Robotics Engineer working on UAVs at [American Robotics](https://www.american-robotics.com/).
My work here involves mainly with improving the vision-based landing system of the American Robotics UAV system, "Scout".

I earned my PhD at The George Washington University, and I worked at the [Flight Dynamics and Control Lab](http://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tylee/). 
My research there involved developing UAV controllers and estimators, and hardware/software systems, that are capable of handling ocean environments.
My dissertation was titled [Geometric Control and Estimation for Autonomous UAVs in Ocean Environments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9kTC167nkdj9AI0NrHs2cKJ0ZV0Ww1i/view).

I received my master's degree at the George Washington University in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, specializing in robotics and control, before starting the PhD program.
I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.
