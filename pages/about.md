I am a current PhD candidate at the [Flight Dynamics and Control Lab](http://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tylee/), at the George Washington University, expecting to graduate soon. 

I received my master's degree at the George Washington University in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, specializing in robotics and control, before starting the PhD program.
I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.
